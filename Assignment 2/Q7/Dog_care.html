                <h4>Feeding</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
                    <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                    <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                    <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                    <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Exercise</h4>
                <p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.</p>
                <h4>Grooming</h4>
                <p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.</p>
